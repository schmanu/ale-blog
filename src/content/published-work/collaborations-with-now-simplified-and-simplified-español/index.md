Now Simplified (@nowsimplified) and Simplified Español (@simplifiedespanol) are Instagram-based platforms that intend to make political topics understandable and accessible for the audience. I collaborated with both platforms in order to create posts about the Colombian National Strike that started on April 28, 2021, and up until today, it is still ongoing. 

Here is the first collaboration, published on May 3 which explained what were the reasons behind the strike and how was the situation at the moment (in Spanish): https://www.instagram.com/p/COakjVSLXzL/ 

The second one was published on May 5 and gave more insight into the extreme levels of police brutality. Published in Spanish and English: https://www.instagram.com/p/COflM-_rI-X/ 

On May 7, Now Simplified published the translated version of the first post, which explained to the English-speaking public what was happening in Colombia: https://www.instagram.com/p/COlUo5ULC7P/

And finally, on June 10, we published a summary of what happened on the first month of the National Strike, in order to show how it was evolving (in Spanish): https://www.instagram.com/p/CP8m4YJLUbP/
