Podcasts are one of my favorite journalistic formats, given their ubiquitous, easy access and the variety of topics available. They are easy and fun ways of learning, informing, and entertaining oneself. 

During my studies, I made some approaches to the format, and this is one of the best results. Along with my classmates, Anne Sophie Lange, Leila Salinas, and Oshin Alawat, and under the supervision of Clarisse Cossais, we developed the podcast 'Berlin Vibes'. 

We chose the topic of techno music in Berlin. We wanted to inquire about the different means it has for people in the city, which varies from just a fun rhythm to dance to, all the way to being almost a religion and having an impact on body image and self-esteem for some people. 

I hope you enjoy it!
