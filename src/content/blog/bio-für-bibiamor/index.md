Bio: 

¡Hola! I am Alejandra Santamaría, a Colombian journalist currently living in Berlin and studying the Digital Journalism Master’s at HMKW – University of Applied Sciences.
I am profoundly interested in investigative journalism, cultural and viral phenomena, creative writing and, content creation. 
My professional experience has been mainly in the field of cultural journalism, collaborating with media like El Espectador, one of Colombia’s oldest and most recognized newspapers, Cromos Magazine and Trampolín Magazine. I also have experience writing content for the press of movies and movie festivals, creating digital strategies to promote theatre spectacles, and as a community manager. 

I participated in different workshops and non-fiction creative writing workshops, like the Gabo Fellowship of Cultural Journalism of the Gabo Foundation, the Cultural Journalism Workshop organized by Arcadia Magazine and the Embassy of Spain in Colombia, and most recently, a memoir writing workshop directed by Indian writer Saskya Jain.
