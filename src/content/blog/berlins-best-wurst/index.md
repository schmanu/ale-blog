Currywurst is the essential Berlin meal and an icon of the city. 

Along with Anne Sophie Lange and Sonia Chien, we investigated a bit of the history behind this specialty and did a test flavor between two very recognized Currywurst joints: Konnopke's Imbiss and Curry 36.

The production and filming were done between the three of us, and I was in charge of editing. 

 What do you think? Which one is your preferred Currywurst?
