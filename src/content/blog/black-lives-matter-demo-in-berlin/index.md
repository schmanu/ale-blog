With my classmates Alondra Rangel and Nikolaj Wissing, we cover the demonstration supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in Berlin and protesting the killing of George Floyd in the United States by the police. 

This video results from our coverage, in which we provide data and information on the matter. I did the editing of the video, and you can also catch me in front of the camera. 

Enjoy!
